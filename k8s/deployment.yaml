  # Here we define the rolling update strategy
  # - maxSurge define how many pod we can add at a time
  # - maxUnavailable define how many pod can be unavailable
  #   during the rolling update

  # Setting maxUnavailable to 0 would make sure we have the appropriate
  # capacity during the rolling update.
  # You can also use percentage based value instead of integer.
